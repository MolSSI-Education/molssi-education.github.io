MolSSI hosted a “Teach the Teachers” workshop in Arlington, Virginia on August 8-9 to train new instructors to teach the [Python Data and Scripting Workshop](https://molssi-education.github.io/python_scripting_cms/).

MolSSI is developing nationwide network of instructors who can teach this workshop to undergraduate students through conferences, REU programs, university workshops, and other events. The “Teach the Teachers” workshop introduced instructors to the workshop curriculum, discussed best practices in programming instruction, and offered participants the chance to workshop the “live coding” style of teaching used in the curriculum. All curriculum will be made available to workshop participants through Github so they can easily offer a workshop at their own university or in their region.

After completing the workshop, the attendees were given the opportunity to register with MolSSI to be instructors for the curriculum in the future.
