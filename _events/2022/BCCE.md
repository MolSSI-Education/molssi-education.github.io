MolSSI Education will host a workshop and a symposium at the [2022 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education](https://www.bcce2022.org/). 

The workshop, "Teaching Python Scripting for Computational Molecular Sciences", will be on Monday, August 1, and will inform educators how to teach the MolSSI Python Data and Scripting curriculum. Educators will also learn how to build on MolSSI Education resources in their classes. 

The symposium, "Teaching Programming in the Chemistry Curriculum: Approaches, Challenges,
and Best Practices", features 16 speakers who will give talks about integrating programming into their chemistry courses. The symposium was organized by MolSSI Board of Directors member, Prof. [Ashley Ringer McDonald](https://chemistry.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/ashley_mcdonald), and MolSSI Education Lead, [Jessica Nash](https://molssi.org/molssi-software-scientists/mss-jessica-nash/), and will be on Tuesday, August 2, 2022.
