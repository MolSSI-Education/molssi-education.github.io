Over 50 students and instructors gathered at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu) July 22-31 for the biennial MolSSI Software Summer School. We covered a broad range of topics including programming in Python and C++, version control, and code collaboration.

Students were placed into groups and completed projects where they converted a Python script which performed a simulation into a collaborative software project.
