# Externally Developed Educational Resources

Here are a number of educational resources that are external to the MolSSI, though many of these have been developed by MolSSI Software Scientists, MolSSI Associates, and other partners. If you would like to have a resource included here, please [edit this page](https://github.com/MolSSI-Education/molssi-education.github.io/blob/master/external-resources.md) and submit a pull request on GitHub.

## [Q-Chem for Teaching](http://www.q-chem.com/InstructionalMatls.html)

Instructions how to use Q-Chem for teaching via the IQmol interface, as well as a selection of computational assignments that can be given to students as homework or in-class exercises. The list of labs includes 10 labs covering different types of quantum-chemical calculations. We hope that this list will continue to grow and would like to encourage the community  to submit new computational labs for sharing.

For low-volume users, we offer a free service: such users can submit short Q-Chem jobs (up to 5 min) to the  Q-Chem server without purchasing a license (IQmol is automatically configured for the submission to the Q-Chem server).

## [Psi4 Education](https://admiring-tesla-08529a.netlify.app/posts/psi4education/)

Computational Labs Using Free Software Computational chemistry is an increasingly important part of modern research, and yet it is often not part of the typical undergraduate or graduate curriculum. Fortunately, the availability of free software like PSI4 and WebMO lowers the barrier to introducing computational chemistry laboratory modules. The labs below were created using only free software and are available for use in your classes.
