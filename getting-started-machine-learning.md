# Getting Started in Machine Learning

1. Build the breadth of ML knowledge by taking a FULL course in ML, ideally a graduate level at STAT/MATH/CS departments. If not available, then take a complete online course (as described in this guide).
2. Never reply solely on notebooks or online tutorials to learn the basics to avoid the common knowledge gaps. Think of a researcher with zero statistical knowledge trying to learn just from tutorials, surely their published analysis will have serious flaws.

### Recommended Book:

**[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Hands-On+Machine+Learning+with+Scikit-Learn%2C+Keras%2C+and+TensorFlow&qid=1609349241&s=books&sr=1-3)** Systems 2nd Edition, by *Aurélien Géron* , and its [notebooks](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2).

Other well-known references for statistical background could be used to understand the statistical theories and proofs If needed.

### Fundamental background (prerequisites):

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Probabilities and statistics
- Basic programming

### General Machine Learning:

For this section, you can take a Machine learning or data science university course, take an online course, or study a textbook. Here we suggest the online track if university courses are not available.


  1. For Fundamentals
  - If you prefer courses, the gold-standard is: [Machine Learning, by Andrew Ng, Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    - Must take for ML basics
    - Viewed by more than 8M students, 2.7M enrolled in the new system
    - Theory, language-independent in general (but examples in Octave, a Matlab-like language)

  - If you prefer Textbooks, the free book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)

  2. [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
  - Udemy, ~$20
  - 500k+ students took the course (4.5 stars rating)
  - 41 hrs, hands-on projects

  3. Theory and practical
  [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
  - Udemy, ~$20
  - 21 hrs
  - Practical -- Excellent instructor
  - Not deep in fundamentals, but good hands-on



### Neural Networks and Deep learning:


  1. [Deep Learning for Molecules and Materials](https://whitead.github.io/dmol-book/intro.html)
  
  This textbooks covers deep learning for molecules and materials with code examples and theory. It starts from ML and works up to modern methods in deep learning
  
  2. [Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/)
  - Udemy
  - 22 hrs
  - Practical, explains the basics,
  - but NO mathematics
  3. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
  - Coursera (free without certification)
  - From Andrew Ng Deep.ai
  - Theory and how to use → experience
  - Can be taken for free (if Audit), or pay to get a certificate
  - Part of a full 5 courses specialization (RNN,hyperparameters opt, ...etc)

  4. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization, and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
  - Part of the above specialization

### Very comprehensive articles: (not to replace courses)
