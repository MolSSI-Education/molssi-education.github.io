# Workshop Requests

MolSSI offers the option of requesting Best Practices workshops at your instutition. If you would like to bring a Best Practices Workshop to your university, fill out [this form](https://molssi.typeform.com/to/FGYzou) to request one!

Best Practices Workshops last approximately 1.5 days, and are targeted at programmers who wish to start using MolSSI Best Practices on their projects. The workshops include an introduction to version control, GitHub collaboration, testing, continuous integration, and documentation in the Python programming language. To see the exact topics covered in this workshop, please refer to the [online materials](https://molssi-education.github.io/CMS-Python-DevOps/).

For this request, we require guarantee of at least 15 attendees (maximum 35 students), and at least two months of advance notice. Requests which involve two or more research groups will be prioritized. A student or post doc must be provided as a point of contact for planning logistics.
