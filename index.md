# Education at MolSSI

Education of students, post-docs, and faculty on programming and Best Practices in Software Development is a large part of MolSSI's mission. Our education program consists of our cohorts of [Software Fellows](https://molssi.org/molssi-software-fellows/), [online training materials](https://molssi-education.github.io/resources.html), and [multiple workshops at various locations each year around the country](https://molssi-education.github.io/request.html).

MolSSI’s education techniques and practices are modeled after [The Software Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/) style to teaching novice software best practices. This approach teaches subjects that not only increase a student’s scientific capability and efficiency, but also his/her future marketability in both scientific and non-scientific fields. The MolSSI promotes SWC-style lessons by combining open-classroom and cognitive-map learning. We engage large portions of the CMS community (and beyond) through demographically and geographically diverse workshops aimed at both novice and intermediate learners.

MolSSI offers a number of education workshops for students and post docs in the computational molecular sciences. These workshops cover a range of material, from basic scripting to writing programs which use MolSSI Best Practices. See our [Resources](https://molssi-education.github.io/resources.html) page for a more complete list of tutorials, or the [calendar](https://molssi-education.github.io/calendar.html) for upcoming educational events.
