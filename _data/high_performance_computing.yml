  description: These lessons introduce basic parallelization techniques and best practices. There are several examples that cover the topic of distributed-memory parallelization using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and shared-memory parallelization using OpenMP. Examples are provided both in C++ and in Python using the mpi4py wrapper. Both the MPI and OpenMP tutorials begin with simple “Hello World!” codes and culminate in the parallelization of a simple molecular dynamics code.
